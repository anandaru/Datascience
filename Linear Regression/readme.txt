The below use case for used-car price and age is used to demonstrate modeling a Simple Linear Regression fit using sklearn.linear_model to predict price based on age using Python 

#Table shows the age in years and the retail value in thousands of dollars of a random sample of ten automobiles of the same make and model.
#Construct the scatter diagram in matplotlib and seaborn.
#Compute the linear correlation coefficient r. Interpret its value in the context of the problem.
#Compute the least squares regression line. Plot it on the scatter diagram.
#Interpret the meaning of the slope of the least squares regression line in the context of the problem.
#Suppose a four-year-old automobile of this make and model is selected at random. Use the regression equation to predict its retail value.
#Suppose a 20-year-old automobile of this make and model is selected at random. Use the regression equation to predict its retail value. Interpret the result.
#Comment on the validity of using the regression equation to predict the price of a brand new automobile of this make and model.
#predict the values as per regression line and add in new column to dataframe 
#Evaluate the regression model (MAE, MSE, RMSE)
#Run a polynomial transformation. Add to dataframe. Plot the graph.
#Evaluate the new model (MAE, MSE, RMSE) and analyze if its a better fit compared to linear regression.
#save dataframe to new csv
